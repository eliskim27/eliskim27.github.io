                <p>
                    I am a software engineer! 
                    I come from a background in sales and education technology.
                    Before that, I spent some time in the US Army, where I learned and grew in so many ways.
                    I learned to be mission oriented: to always keep the bigger picture in mind,
                    and to plan and strategize, but also stay flexible to inevitable curveballs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love programming!
                    I love that it's such a creative endeavor that's always changing and growing.
                    It's a craft that I want to continue to improve and master.
                    I love that we're creating real solutions to real problems, 
                    no matter how big or small they might be.
